            Here is a disclaimer: I understand most likely all of these concepts
            processed through this page have solutions already developed, but
            the point is to have to work through fundamental software issues.
            Everything within me wants to re invent the wheel, not to do it
            better but to understand the steps taken to get there.

              <li>Primary use of this page is content communication</li>
              <li>Priority then falls on an efficient way to create posts</li>
              <li>Lets look at some issues I am facing now</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Having to write all HTML and content at the same time</li>
                <li>
                  Copying and pasting older posts to scaffold out new posts
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Ideal solutions</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow scripts to write the html for us</li>
                <li>Let scripts implement the html</li>
                <li>
                  Prioritize the process of writing first with minimal format
                  worries
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      I would rather worry about how to write mark down in a
                      file than writing content and html at the same time
